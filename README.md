## Social Science Questions
The US Congress is known for having increasing polarization and thus questionable effectiveness with regard to making and passing bills, approving presidential nominations, as well as budgeting. While studying legislative effectiveness, existing literature focuses on the important personal and institutional attributes such as race, gender, and ethnicity that make some Congressmen and Congresswomen more effective legislators than their peers. However, only a limited amount of attention has been directed to individual-based social networks within Congress. Can issue-oriented and committee-oriented cross-partisan social net- works help overcome congressional gridlocks and mitigate polarization? This paper seeks to investigate the impact of these two types of social networks on legislative effectiveness score[^1] of each legislator in the 116th Congress: How does issue-oriented cross-partisan social networks[^2] and committee-oriented cross-partisan social networks affect legislative effectiveness of each legislator from 116th to 117th Congress (from 2019 to 2022)? Which type of networks has a larger impact on legislative effectiveness? I believe by examining these two types of social networks and their effect on legislative effectiveness, we are one step closer to understanding legislative bargaining, policy making, and political representation on a federal level. Note that I am also proposing to do the same project (or parts of it) for my perspectives and social network analysis class. 

Currently, I have completed constructing committee-oriented cross-partisan social networks and analyzing its effect on legislative effectiveness on the 116th Congress using social network and regression analysis. 

## Large-Scale Computing Strategies

I will need to utilize large scale computing methods to construct issue-oriented networks. In order to extract issue-based networks and prepare them for 
social network and regression analysis, I will need to scrape the Congressional records for 116th and 117th Congress from Congress.gov[^3], and apply topic modeling to pull out the top N issues, alongside with some regular expression to pull out the legislators associated with each issue.

[^1]: Legislative effectiveness score is a measure devised by Volden and Wiseman to account for the combination of a Congress memberâ€™s bill progress and the ability to pass more significant bills (Volden and Wiseman, 2009 and 2014). For details, please visit: https://thelawmakers.org/category/legislative-effectiveness-scores# 

[^2]: Here, issue-oriented cross-partisan networks refer to social networks formed by legislators who bring up or discuss the same issues as reflected by Congressional record: the official daily record of the debates and proceedings of the U.S. Congress.

## Workflow
1. Scrape and clean congressional record: Code can be found in [scrape_cr.py](https://github.com/lsc4ss-s22/final-project-congress/blob/master/scrape_cr.py). My goal is to parallelize the scraping and cleaning process.

      Locally, run: 

            python3 scrape_cr.py

      Senate record from 2019 will be stored in ```senate_speech (1).json```  <br />
      Senate record from 2020 will be stored in ```senate_speech (2).json```  <br />
      House record from 2019-2020 will be stored in ```house_speech.json``` 

      All the json files map a speaker to his/her speeches in congressional record from 2019-2020 <br />

2. Merge speech dataset and LES dataset: Code and output can be found in [1_merge_speech_and_LES.ipynb](https://github.com/lsc4ss-s22/final-project-congress/blob/master/1_merge_speech_and_LES.ipynb).

3. Upload the merged dataset to s3: Code and output can be found in [2_upload_to_S3.ipynb](https://github.com/lsc4ss-s22/final-project-congress/blob/master/2_upload_to_S3.ipynb).

4. Topic modelling using pyspark and spark nlp: Code and output can be found in [3_topic_model.ipynb](https://github.com/lsc4ss-s22/final-project-congress/blob/master/3_topic_model.ipynb).

5. Construct issue-based congressional networks: Code, output, and analysis can be found in [4_construct_network.ipynb](https://github.com/lsc4ss-s22/final-project-congress/blob/master/4_construct_network.ipynb).

6. Regression analysis: Code, output, and analysis can be found in [5_analysis.pdf](https://github.com/lsc4ss-s22/final-project-congress/blob/master/5_analysis.pdf).
